I am a robotics engineer by trade, so I have a decent knowledge base as far as
software development. This guide can be fairly opinionated on the basis of that
experience, but that does not mean everything is correct for your use cases.
Take the information however you wish. To me a computer is a general purpose
tool, while software adapts it for specific purposes, analagous to different
bits and sockets in a drill. These are notes about ready-made software packages
that can be useful in aiding you with different tasks. Certain hobby-specific
knowledge and hardware-focused details are contained elsewhere.
