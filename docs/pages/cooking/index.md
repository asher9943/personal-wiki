I am not a chef, just a home cook. Everything here is recorded because I find it
to be a good balance of efficiency and taste. I want to make good food and still
have free time. And I don't need some dickhead youtuber telling me to spend 5
hours making the bread from scratch. Any equipment I reccomend is because I
found it to be useful (no paid deal). Indeed you will find a lot of it is
inexpensive. There are many areas where paying more nets a better product, but I
rarely find this to be the case with kitchen supplies.
